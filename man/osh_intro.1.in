.SH NAME
\fBosh_intro\fP - Overview of OpenSHMEM programs
.SH DESCRIPTION
OpenSHMEM is a PGAS programming library that can use
hardware capabilities such as RDMA for fast direct-to-memory
communication.
.LP
This manual page documents the commands associated with this
implementation.

.SH TOOLS
.IP COMPILERS
.IP C 4
This is the core interface that is always present.
C programs can be compiled/linked using oshcc(1).
.IP C++ 4
If this interface has been enabled, C++ programs can be
compiled/linked using oshcxx(1).
.IP Fortran 4
If this interface has been enabled, Fortran programs can be
compiled/linked using oshfort(1).
.IP LAUNCHER
In this implementation, OpenSHMEM programs can be launched via
oshrun(1).  Job scheduling systems, such as PBS/Torque, SLURM, and
LSF, may provide compatible launchers as well (e.g. srun in SLURM,
aprun in ALPS).
.IP INFORMATION
.IP osh_info 4
