.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoshrun\fP runs an OpenSHMEM program on the given number of
processing elements.
.SH NUMBER OF PROCESSING ELEMENTS
.IP "-n N | -np N" 4
Run the program on N processing elements (PEs or processors).
Overrides any PE count inherited from launch environment.
.LP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
OpenSHMEM environment variables are prefixed with "SHMEM_".  Some
older SHMEM implementations had variables prefixed with "SMA_": these
are still supported in OpenSHMEM, but are deprecated.  If both are set
for a given variable, the "SHMEM_" one will be used.
.LP
Boolean flags are enabled with a non-zero value, or "y", "yes";
disabled with zero value, or "n", "no".
.RS
.IP "SHMEM_VERSION (bool)"
print library version at start-up
.IP "SHMEM_INFO (bool)"
print information about supported environment variables
.IP "SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_SIZE (number)"
set the size of the symmetric heap.  Can use K,M,G,T units
.IP "SHMEM_DEBUG (bool)"
enable run debugging (if configured).
.IP "SHMEM_DEBUG_FILE (string)"
file to receive debugging information.

.SH EXAMPLES
The command
.LP
.RS
$ oshrun -np 4 ./sping.x -e 8192
.RE
.LP
runs the Quadrics ping-pong example code on 4 processing elements, and
passes the arguments "-e" and "8192" through to the OpenSHMEM program.
.SH NOTES
.LP
The OpenSHMEM specification does not say anything normative about how
OpenSHMEM programs are compiled, linked and launched.  These wrapper
programs are supplied as part of the Reference Library for
convenience.
