- Debug the following for runtime errors:
  - shmem_broadcast<size>
  - shmem_<typename>_broadcast
  - shmem_broadcastmem
  - shmem_alltoallsmem

- Implement the following:
  - reductions


- All collectives
  - Check the logger string formats in shcoll-shim.c
  - Add a checker to make sure sure src and dest data are on the
    symmetric heap

- Handle the creation of c11 bindings for all new/updated routines
  - shmem_sync
    - Figure out how to make the 1.4<= version of shmem_sync backward compatible
      in the C11 bindings
    - implement the generic team-based sync for the C11 bindings
  
-shmem_info_get_version
  - Update to the current version (if not done already)

- handle pshmem insterface for all the new stuff (if necessary)

- Do we need to deal with extensions for additional types for the collectives?
