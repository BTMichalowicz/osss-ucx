- Reimplent shmem_team_sync so it uses the deprecated shmem_sync's subroutines
  Need to implement shmem_team_sync along with the collectives.

- Table registration for reductions and tpyed colls

- All collectives
  - Check the logger string formats in shcoll-shim.c
  - Add a checker to make sure sure src and dest data are on the
    symmetric heap?

- Update include/pshmem.h with all the new routines

- Do we need to deal with extensions for additional types for the collectives?

- All new routines. Should we be checking whether shmem_init has been called
  in everything? i.e., something like this:

    SHMEMU_CHECK_INIT();
    SHMEMU_CHECK_PE_ARG_RANGE(pe, 8);
    SHMEMU_CHECK_SYMMETRIC(dest, 2);
    SHMEMU_CHECK_SYMMETRIC(src 5);
