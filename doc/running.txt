Prerequisites
=============

PMIx
====

v1.2.x, or newer, release; or from github master:

    PMIx      : https://github.com/pmix/pmix/

UCX
===

Tested with all releases and from github master:

    UCX       : https://github.com/openucx/ucx/

If you want to build threading support, UCX should be installed with

    --enable-mt

OpenMPI
=======

For PMIx-aware "mpiexec" launcher:

    OpenMPI downloads : https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/

Combinations
============

For all users, any version of UCX is fine.

The interaction with most impact is that of PMIx and Open-MPI:

  o For end-users, the easiest route is PMIx 1.2.5 and Open-MPI 2.1.3
    to provide a stable launch environment.

  o For developers, the github master versions throughout will track
    all the latest updates.

Building Sequence
=================

1. In the top-level source directory, run ./autogen.sh

2. You can build this package either in-source-tree or
   out-of-source-tree

3. configure script can be told where PMIx and UCX live, and other
   options

4. make and make install
